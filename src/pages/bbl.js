                        In butt aesthetic, patient’s own fat is used to shape the hips As the fat is from the patient, results are completely natural and it won’t be understood that those flawless hips are operation results. If the patient lack sufficient fat to be transferred, filling materials can be used as well.<br/><br/>


                        Brazilian Butt Lift (BBL), also known as Brazilian Butt Aesthetic, is preferred for people who wants to have younger looking, distinct hips and a correct body profile. Your own fat is used in this surgical procedure and this is the most natural way to augment your hips.
                        In Brazilian Butt Aesthetic, we transfer the fat collected from your regional fat depositions in the purest and most suitable fat-stem cell composition possible. This helps to achieve the longest lasting result. This procedure, which also collect fat extraction with liposuction, involves enrichment of extracted fat with stem cells. Fat extraction is performed with liposuction. And centrifuge devices are used to enrich the fat with stem cells. The last step is the re-injection of the fat into the hips. The procedure is designed to fill the upper quadrant of your hips; this lifts the butt and makes it more prominent. Resulting effect makes your profile more attractive.<br/><br/>


                        To go in detail, first, we open 1 mm holes on certain areas of your body and extract the fat by using 3 mm thin cannulas. Small cannula holes let us collect even the smallest fat pieces. Fat collected with liposuction is centrifuged and enriched in terms of stem cells; fat collected from these regions are carefully processed. Only a portion of the collected donor fat will be eligible for injection to hips. In most cases, more than 33% of the extracted fat will be suitable for re-injection. Therefore, transfer with stem cells increases the permanence of the procedure. Only the best donor fat cells are re-injected to your hips. We try to extract fat from at least two, preferably three, parts of your body for sufficient and proper fat collection.

                        In butt aesthetic, regional fat depositions around different parts of the body (generally from abdominal area) are collected and transferred to the hips. Application of special “Cihantimur Fat Transfer” method to prevent cells from being damaged during transfer and guarantee their permanence is one of the most important steps. Operation is performed under the specified anesthesia type and takes about 1.5-2 hours. You will be informed to stop eating and drinking 6 hours before the operation. This is the only thing you have to do!

                        If you have fat deposition problem in another part of your body, collection of that fat is another advantage for you to have a better look. Breast augmentation, breast lift and abdominal lift are the operations that can be combined with butt lift for a thinner and tighter look. Removal of the fat around the waist will also provide a more curved proportion. If necessary, this operation can also be performed in combination with butt aesthetic.
