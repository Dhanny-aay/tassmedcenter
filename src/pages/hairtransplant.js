            <p className=" text-center md:px-[8%] mt-3 text-base md:text-lg text-[#121212CC]">Hair Transplant can be defined as hair follicle transfer. Hair Transplant is the transfer of hair follicles collected from denser Hairy areas (nape and sides) to the sparse areas. Hair Transplant is a highly preferred and permanent method as it provides natural and healthy results. Hair Transplant also resolves various psychological problems and social introversion caused by hair loss.</p>

                        There are many factors, causes and triggering elements involved in the reasons of hair loss. Hair loss, which is one of the most frequent problems of our time, may be due to genetic predisposition, unhealthy nutrition, chronic diseases, excess hairstyling and many other triggering factors. We can examine hair loss cases in two categories: male pattern hair loss and female pattern hair loss.<br/><br/>
                        Androgenetic alopecia, known as male pattern hair loss, can start during early twenties and results in hair loss especially at the top and front strip of the head within a few years. Reasons of male pattern hair loss are related to genetic infrastructure.<br/><br/>

                        And female pattern hair loss is a common condition that can be seen 1 in every 10 women around the world. Genetic background or other factors are responsible. This hair loss type that is characterized by thin, weak hair and especially distinct loss in the hair separation line can be resolved with modern and effective results through Hair Transplant.<br/><br/>

                        Whatever the reason of hair loss, if it is determined that it is caused by a underlying triggering factor upon investigation, reasonable treatment should be considered first, then hair transplantation can be evaluated. If hormonal diseases or deficiency of vitamin, mineral or any other substance is found, the best option is to try to treat hair loss at a disease level.

                    <div className=" mt-3 text-[#676767] text-sm">
                        Hair loss ratio and rate are reviewed in the Hair Transplant  examination. During the examination, doctor tries to learn how long is hair loss or baldness continue and whether this situation is genetic or triggers other diseases. Different tests are performed to determine. Finally, the donor site, where the healthy hair follicles will be collected from, is decided.

                    <div className=" mt-3 text-[#676767] text-sm">
                        Determination of healthy hair follicles that are eligible for transfer is one of the most important topic of Hair Transplant  procedure. For this, the donor site, the area where follicles will be collected from, must be determined during the examination. The hair follicles that are available for transfer are removed from the nape region most. If this area does not yield the desired amount, the beard, chin area and finally the back, shoulder, leg or chest area are looked at. Determination of the donor site is one of the most important steps for proper planning of the process.<br/><br/>

                        Patients who have developed excessive baldness problems are looked at in the nape area first. If there is no sufficient amount of healthy hair at the back of the neck, the beard area is checked. If the patient suffering baldness problems will not be uncomfortable for the sparseness in the beard area, it is actually a region where the most efficient and high quality results are received for the donor area and there is little compliance problem. The chest donor area is a field with variable efficiency, each type of hair is different, and therefore a prior test transplantation should be performed. Last donor sites to be checked are back and leg areas. In these areas where hair follicles with different structures are present such as the chest, the most eligible and available follicles are collected by considering the comfort of the patient and without forcing them.

                    <p className=" text-base font-semibold text-[#121212] mt-6">Hair Transplant  Methods</p>
                    <div className=" mt-3 text-[#676767] text-sm">
                        he method to be used is decided during the examination after the donor site is determined. Today, there are two methods for hair transplantation: FUT and FUE.<br/>
                        Both methods enable transfer of living hair follicles and do not require general anesthesia. Their difference is in the collection method of hair follicles.<br/>
                        1-FUE : This is the one-by-one hair follicle collection method from the hair area between the two ears or from abovementioned alternate regions by using special device heads that have 0.70-0.80 and 0.90 mm diameter with the use of a micromotor. No use of scalpel in the donor site, no suture and no visible scars in the donor site are among the greatest advantages. More follicles (grafts) can be collected by FUE method and it enables more natural and thick hair growth. This method provides 3000-4000 follicles (grafts) from patients with average hair density.<br/><br/>


                        2-FUT (Follicular Unit Transplantation): This is the separation of follicles (graft), collected by dissecting the scalp between the two ears as a strip, under the microscope. This method is rarely or not preferred at all with the development of FUE method. The reason is in FUT method, scars are left in the donor site and desired number of follicles cannot be collected. Scalpel is used for this method and donor site is sutured; scar is apparent after shaving. Transplanted hair will never be lost again. The most important thing to remember before and after hair transplantation is that each patient is unique and all assessments must be performed exclusively. You can easily get back to your normal life within a few days as the procedure is performed under local anesthesia in hospital conditions. In our Tass Medical center we don’t use FUT method as we prefer innovative hair transplantation techniques and place utmost importance to patient comfort.

                        In general, hair transplantation follows below steps:<br/>
                        •    Determined donor site is prepared<br/>
                        •    Then, transplantation site where collected follicles will be transferred to is prepared.<br/>

                        .
                        After taking your pictures, lines will be drawn to your head to restrict the area. Local anesthesia is performed so that you don't feel pain. You can read a book, watch television or even sleep during this time.<br/>
                        As the donor site is one of the most precious treasure of the patients with baldness, your doctor will collect the hair follicle with utmost care without damaging. There will be a break after a certain amount of time depending on the baldness degree and number of collected hair follicles.<br/><br/>


                        Hair Transplant  starts right after the break is over. Transplantation density is decided based on the hairline, characteristics of the collected hair, age of the patient, and shape of the head and face.  Healthy hair follicles collected from the donor site are planted to the related area in suitable degrees. Direction and angle are the two most important stages of the procedure and they are crucial that the patient's hair won’t look like a hedgehog when grown. At this point, doctor’s aesthetic estimation and professionalism gets into play. Donor site is bandaged and the procedure is completed.

                    <div className=" mt-3 text-[#676767] text-sm">
                        The “shock loss” stage of the planted hair starts at the end of the second week after the Hair Transplant  procedure. New and healthy hair starts to grow back within two months later that.   Almost all transplanted hair will be grown back healthily after eighth month.  As we mentioned before, within 1-2 weeks after transplantation there will be a “SHOCK LOSS” stage. After this sudden hair loss, healthy hair will start to grow within two months and planted hair will almost completely be grown back at the end of the eighth month. If the preferred method is organic hair transplantation, you can have even more efficient and healthy hair.<br/><br/>

                        The most important thing to know is whether hair will be fed or not after transplantation. If your hair is not fed properly and in healthy way, hair loss will be inevitable again. We suggest you to refer our doctors for detailed information.
