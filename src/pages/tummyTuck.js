                    The abdominal region, which has a structure that helps to protect most of our internal organs, is one of the areas where regional fat is observed. The enlarged fat layer often becomes unresponsive to sports, diet and exercise. In addition, skin problems due to collagen breakage, which is called a crack in the skin structure and cause an aesthetic appearance, also constitute a regional problem. Deformation in the abdominal muscles, often observed after high-weight babies, also causes this region to sag.

                    The surgery area of the abdomen lifting operation is the area from the bottom of the last rib bone to the mons pubis. Mons pubis is a raised hairy area on the underside of the cesarean section, which is also referred to as the Venus hill. The problem of excessive fat in the abdominal area is among the issues that men also suffer from. Especially in the case of carbohydrate consuming high-value nutrients, we can say that the abdominal area fattens more. Although fatness tries to be avoided with strict diet lists, it is not possible to get rid of this skin structure and also to get rid of it completely, and this causes Abdomen Lifting operations. Even if the individuals lose weight, they can obtain successful results only from abdominal lifting operations in order to get rid of extended and sagged skin texture.<br/>
                    Individuals suffer from both psychological and health problems due to the fact that their physical movements, such as bending forward due to this tissue sagging, and in some cases due to the formation of bacteria due to sweating.
