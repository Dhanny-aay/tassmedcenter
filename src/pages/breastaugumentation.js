                         Breast augmentation operations are interventions that increases breast volume or correct asymmetry problem. Form loss may occur in breast tissues due to weight gain and loss, and problems after pregnancy or breasts may be extra small from birth. Adding aging and gravity to these over time, apparent reduction and sagging may occur in the breasts. Breast augmentation can be performed to solve all these possible problems and you can have your desired breast size.<br/><br/>
                        
                        Generally implants are used for breast augmentation or fat injection can be performed as explained in Fat Transfer to the Breast section.<br/><br/>
                        
                        Breast Augmentation surgery is possible with silicon implants as well as Fat Trasnfer and patients can have highly natural appearance. The most important thing to keep in my mind during this operation is symmetry and a look that is suitable for the patient.<br/><br/>
                        
                        Personal 3D simulation shows the patient how they will look after breast augmentation and the doctor decide the strategy together with the patient. The patient can see exactly how they will look like after the breast augmentation surgery. Then the doctor plans the operation in line with the decided strategy.<br/><br/>
                        
                        The most important thing here is to ensure that the patient has a natural, symmetric and lively look after breast augmentation surgery.<br/><br/>
                        
                        Breast Augmentation surgeries are one of the procedures that the patients are most satisfied with. Thanks to the advanced technology, patients are highly satisfied as they can see their naturally and symmetrically augmented new breasts through 3D simulation before the operation.<br/><br/>
                        
                         Now it is so easy to obtain perfect results with experienced doctors and state-of-the-art opportunities of Tass Medical Center.

                    <div className=" mt-3 text-[#676767] text-sm">
                        Breast augmentation operations must be accurately planned ahead. At this point, experience of the doctor and use of latests technology are of utmost importance. Our doctors carefully plan the operation using the advanced technology and they determine which methods and procedures will be performed for which patient.<br/><br/>
                        
                        The patient is taken to the operation after it is clarified whether silicon implants or Cihantimur Fat Transfer is more suitable for breast augmentation and the future look is simulated.<br/><br/>
                        
                        If the breast augmentation procedure will be performed by using silicons, doctors decide with which method this will be achieved. Our preference is to use an incision under the breast. This enables the placement of the silicon implant under or over the muscle without any error.<br/><br/>
                        
                        Using an incision along the natural line formed under the breast enables a natural disguise for the scar. In addition to this, procedure can be performed with an incision under the arm, from the belly button or the nipple however, our preference is alway an incision under the breast as it poses the less problematic route.<br/><br/>

                    <div className=" mt-3 text-[#676767] text-sm">
                        Due to legal reasons, we cannot publish the Breast Augmentation Surgery Prices on our website. If you contact us on this regard, you will receive detailed information.<br/><br/>
                        How Many Methods Are There for Breast Augmentation Implant Placement?<br/><br/>
                        
                        Breast augmentation prostheses can be placed by several different methods. Our preference, and the most problem-free method, is to perform a small and thin incision along the natural line under the breast. The operation can be performed with ease and smoothly.<br/><br/>
                        
                        Prosthesis can be placed from the armpit aside from this method. There will be no incision scar around the breast after this method, incision will be on armpit.<br/><br/>
                        
                        Another method is to place the silicons by entering through the belly button. Slight redness may occur around the incisions after these operations, however, these will fade away in time and go back to their natural color.<br/><br/>
                        
                        Symmetry and Natural Look Must be the Priority in the Decision of the Breast Augmentation Prosthesis Size
                        As we always tell our patients, beauty is natural. Applications must be personal. Sizes suitable for one person may not be suitable for another one. Therefore, priority must be to determine the most suitable sizes for you. Now, we can let the patients see their post-operative shapes before the surgery by using advanced technology 3D imaging systems.<br/><br/>
                        
                        We put priority to a natural look as we determine the personal size. After deciding the size according to the patient’s preferences, necessary plans are prepared for the breast augmentation surgery.

                    <div className=" mt-3 text-[#676767] text-sm">
                        Lifespan of Breast Augmentation Silicon implants varies from person to person. If the patient is happy the look and there are no changes, they can continue to use. With the new advanced technology, manufacturers offer long lifespans and this can be even extended to whole life. The most important thing here is the satisfaction of the patients with their looks.<br/><br/>
    
                        If the patient is happy with their look, they can be sure that silicon is healthy and staying well in its place. If there is much activity due to sports or lifestyle, then appearance-wise problems may emerge within 10-15 years. In such cases, necessary interventions can be made and revised and patient satisfaction can be restored. Although not as frequent as in the past, such secondary surgeries can be performed when deemed necessary.

                        With the developed technology, it is very difficult to notice for a uninformed person. The similarity of the silicons with natural breast tissue makes them harder to notice. It is even harder for generally preferred under muscle silicon implant applications. As the priority is a natural look, it is almost impossible to notice when looking from outside. Preferring overly large silicons in comparison to the standard size of the patient may lead to guessing, however, as long as a natural look is maintained, there will be a natural and lively look and it will be very difficult tell the difference.
